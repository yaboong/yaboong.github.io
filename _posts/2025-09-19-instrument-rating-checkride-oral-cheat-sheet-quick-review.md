## Intro
* There's a lot to study for your IR checkride oral, and trying to review everything can be inefficient when you're short on time.
* So, I’ve summarized and simplified the essential knowledge into a very simple format.
* This isn't a detailed, in-depth explanation of each topic.
* It's meant for quick review when you want to rapidly go over everything you've studied, especially in the week leading up to your exam.

## Weather Theory
- **abbreviation for this section**: t-storm(thunderstorm), vis(visibility), w.(wind), p.(pressure), turb(turbulence), cl.(cloud), ws(wind shear), alt(altitude)
- **atmosphere**: [nitrogen78/oxygen21/argon0.9/water-vapor0-4]%
- **standard day**: 15℃ (59℉), 29.92”Hg (1013.2hPa or mb)
- **heat exchange**: sun uneven heating → warm(less dense)↑ & cold(denser)↓ → air movement
- **stable air**: resists vertical motion, stratiform, smooth air, steady precipitation, fair-poor vis
- **unstable air**: promotes vertical motion, towering(cumuliform), rough air, showery precipitation, t-storms., good vis
- **lapse rate**: rate at which temp↓ as alt↑, standard 1000’↑ [2℃/1”Hg]↓, steeper(temp↓rapidly as alt↑) → unstable/convective act
- **temp inversion**: temp↑ as alt↑, hot-day&cool-night→ ground cools → still hot above → warm air lid → trapping cooler air → vis↓(smog/haze),wind shear
- **wind shear**: sudden change wind speed/direction in small area
  - sudden drastic change in IAS, affect lift & control, low-level ws (less time to recover)
  - mainly occurs: t-storms, frontal boundary (cold front), temperature inversion, CAT at high, microbursts
- **mountain wave**: strong w. blow perpendicular to mountain, severe turb, lenticular/rotor cl.
- **factors affecting wind**: 
  - pressure diff [diff↑→wind↑]
  - coriolis force: earth’s rotation, deflect wind/air right Norther Hem., poles↑equator:0
  - friction btwn air/surface: slows down wind→coriolis force↓→wind flow across isobars at slight angle toward low pressure (surface wind slower & turb. than winds aloft)
  - gravity: vertical air movements (downbursts/microbursts)
- **isobar**: connect points equal pressure, closer→pressure gradient↑→wind↑
- **high pressure**: air moves[outward/downward/clockwise], typically clear&stable, sinking air warms up→preventing clouds forming
- **low pressure**: air moves[inward/upward/counter-clockwise], generally cloudy&unstable, often rain/snow, rising air cools→moisture condense→[form clouds,icing risk]
- **trough**: brown, elongated area of low p., air↑(can’t sink or spread)→cloud forms&precipitation→often bad weather
- **ridge**: yellow, elongated area of high p., air↓→often good weather
- **turbulence**: unsteady/irregular motion of air
  - thermal turb: hot days→uneven heating→warm air↑→cumulus clouds & storms
  - mechanical turb: wind blowing over [rough ground/mountains]→choppy air
  - frontal turb: two air masses(cold front)→warm air↑→instability&bumps
  - CAT: invisible in clear sky, often near jet stream (due to strong wind shear)
- **dew point**: temperature at which air becomes saturated → no longer hold water vapor → condensation begins (water vapor → liquid)
  - closer temp&dewpoint→humidity↑visible moisture↑(fog/clouds/dew/frost/rain)→ vis↓
  - aircraft surface == dew point → frost
  - temperature < dew point → icing
- **precipitation**: any form of water that falls from the atmosphere (rain/drizzle/sleet/hail)
  - sleet: snow(solid, ice crystals)+freezing rain(rapid structural icing)
  - hail: ice pellets produced by strong updrafts in thunderstorms
- **fronts**: boundaries between two air masses
  - squall line? → ahead of a cold front
  - cold front moves over mountainous? → icing
  - frontal waves? → slowly moving cold fronts or stationary fronts
  - low level wind shear? → warm front (temperature inversion)
- **cold front (blue)**: [cold/dense/fast-moving/20-30kts or faster] air forces warm air to rise rapidly → steep frontal surface, generally more intense (after:temperature↓&clr sky)
  - hazards: rapid weather change(few hours), towering cumulous(nimbus), strong turbulence, gusty winds, heavy precip, squall line t-storms., hail, tornadoes
- **warm front (red)**: [warm/less dense/slow-moving/10-15kts] air glides up over cooler air mass → gradual frontal slope, generally less intense, produce [wide area of weather/stratiform/ceiling↓/vis↓/rain/drizzle&fog]
  - hazards: freezing rain → icing (warm rain falls into cold air layer and freeze)
- **stationary front (red&blue)**: two air masses balanced, neither is advancing, can last for days, mixed cold&warm fronts, hazards[low-intensity precip, poor vis, low cloud]
- **occluded front (purple)**: fast-moving cold front catches up slower-moving warm front → lifting warm air mass entirely off the ground, mixed cold&warm fronts
  - hazards: strong winds/turbulence/embedded thunderstorms with thick cloud layers]
  - more severe when warm front occlusion (embedded thunderstorms)
- **clouds**: moist air cooled to its dew point → water vapor condenses into tiny liquid
  - caused by lifting: convective(air heated&rise), orographic(air rise by mountain), frontal
  - hazards: icing, turb(cumuliform clouds), vis↓, thunderstorms
- **cloud types**: cumulus(piled), stratus(in layers), cirrus(high-level,20000↑), nimbus (rain-bearing), alto(middle-level,5000-20000)
  - lenticularus: lens-shaped, formed over mountains in strong winds
  - virga - contains strong downdrafts
  - rotor clouds
- **thunderstorm**: unstable(steep)lapse rate, sufficient moisture(small temp-dewpoint spread), lifting action(surface heat, orographic, frontal)
- **thunderstorm stages:** cumulus[cloud develop/strong updrafts], mature[most intense/up&down-drafts/rainfall begins/severe turb/wind shear/lighting/hail], dissipating[weakens/mostly downdrafts/rainfall decrease/often anvil top]
- **thunderstorm caution**: keep 20NM distance (hail/rain can be thrown up to 20NM)
- **microburst**: [undetectable/small/strong]downdraft→sudden/powerful winds near ground
  - losing altitude 6000ft/min, dangerous WS(especially takeoff/landing)
  - wind(150mph=131kts), short-lived, lasting 5-15 min, less than 2.5 miles wide
- **fog** (PAIRUS): cloud near surface(50’), air cools to its dew point & moisture added
  - precipitation: rain→moisture evaporates→humidity↑→air saturated, warm rain through cooler air[warm front/temperature inversion]
  - advection: warm/moist air moves over cooler surface (coastal areas), opposite of steam fog, forms quickly, cover large areas
  - ice: extremely cold (below -25°F), Arctic regions
  - radiation: calm/clear night, ground cools air above, dissipate with sunrise
  - upslope: wind pushes moist/stable air to upsloping terrain (mountain obscuration)
  - steam: cold/dry air moves over warm water
- **fog vs mist**: fog(vis<5/8mile), mist(5/8≤vis<7) is often dissipating form of fog
- **frost**: surface below freezing, water vapor condenses onto that surface
  - effects: even thin layer→significantly disrupt airflow→lift↓drag↑→stall speed↑
  - hazards: dangerous especially during takeoff, block [pitot tubes, static port]
  - removal: [anti-icing/de-icing] fluid, wipe off, melt in [heated hanger, sun]
- **freezing rain**: rain→ice (it was rain above but freezes at current altitude -> rain that starts to freeze)
  - temperature inversion: above warm layer → cold → snow → [snow→rain] at warm layer → [rain→ice] at cold surface → ice pellets at surface means [freezing rain/supercooled water] at higher altitude
  - rain from air 0℃↑ → into air 0℃↓
  - rain freezes on impact
  - temp could be 0℃↑ at higher alt.
  - freezing drizzle→warmer air above
- **wet snow**: ice→rain (it was snow above but melts at current altitude -> snow that starts to melt)
  - wet snow at your alt.→ temp>freezing → freezing level above

## Icing
- **PA28**: defroster, carb heat, pitot heat
- **intensity**: trace, light, moderate(accumulation 1~3inches/hour), severe
- **low-pressure areas**: rising air → cool down → visible moisture↑ → icing risk↑
- **performance degradation:** 
  - 1/2 inch ice → lift↓ by 50%
  - icing→disrupts airflow(lift↓thrust↓drag↑weight↑)→AoA↑→stall speed↑
  - approach speed↑, landing distance↑
  - sandpaper-like icing on leading edge and upper surface → lift↓by30%&drag↑by40%
- **mitigate**: icing&rolling→use aileron↓rudder↑, tailplane stall→use caution app&land, disengage auto-pilot VS mode, deicing, anti-icing
  - hand fly, find cloud base/top, leave visible moisture (climb/descend/turn), warmer temperature, lower humidity
  - in some cases, reaching -10℃ could be an option, since visible moisture is less likely to be present
- **types**: instrument, induction, structural
  - instrument icing: forms on instruments & sensors → inaccurate readings → pitot-heat
  - induction icing: forms in engine’s air intake system → airflow↓ → disrupts air/fuel mixture → engine performance↓ → engine failure (carb icing)
    - carburetor icing: forms when [temperatures (-7~21℃, 70℉) / relative humidity above 80%], due to steep temperature drop in carburetor venturi → carb heat
  - structural icing: forms when visible moisture contacts below freezing aircraft surface, forms on exterior surface (wings/tail/props) → change airfoil shape → risk↑
    - clear: large droplet spreads. [smooth/clear/hard/dense]→difficult [detect/remove]
    - rime: small droplets freeze instantly. [milky(rough&white) color, brittle texture] → easier to spot, forms on thinner parts (wing edges)
    - mixed: when [snow/rain] coexists(unstable/mixed clouds), severe performance loss
- **+structural icing**: “most likely”→freezing rain (“least” likely→high clouds), mostly form on tail in rain when temperature few degree above freezing, opposite of ICTS
- **SLD (Supercooled Large droplets)**
  - liquid water droplets that remain in a liquid state even at temp below freezing.
  - occur aloft even without precipitation at surface.
  - visual indication: droplets that splash on impact at temperatures below 5℃
- **freezing level**: lowest altitude temperature 0°C, must get accurate freezing level before IFR, sources [AWC/winds aloft forecast (FB)/PIREP/weather briefing]
- **FIKI**: [frost/ice/snow] on airplane→not allowed, but deicing or anti-icing equip to protect[wings/windshield/controls/instrument]? → allowed (use caution)
- **icing on airfoils**: shape change→weight↑lift↓(less noticeable at low AoA)→stall speed↑
  - small ice→localized stall→roll/spin, likely form first on tailplane, flaps already extended?(never retract)→retract?→stall speed↑
- **roll upset**: can be caused by localized stall, try [AoA↓/airspeed↑/extend flaps/wings level]
- **tailplane**: tailplane creates tail-down force→nose-up moment→counteracts nose-down moment created by lift, better ice collector than wings
- **tailplane icing (ICTS)**: Ice Contaminated Tailplane Stall, mostly during approach/landing
  - tailplane icing→tail-down force↓→nose-down↑ ← don’t [deploy flaps or speed↑]
    - if flaps or speed↑→lift↑→even more nose-down
  - symptoms: elevator[vibration↑effectiveness↓heavier] & uncommanded nose-down
  - recovery: retract flaps immediately, and then speed↑ to counteract flap retraction, slowly control nose-down pitch, no-flaps approach
- **plan&predict** (CAFFU): Cloud layers, Air temperature & pressure (more likely in low-pressure areas, cool temperatures), Fronts movement, Freezing level, Use weather briefing (METAR/TAF/AIRMET/SIGMET)
- **anti-icing/deicing**: anti-icing(prevention), deicing(removal)
  - for airfoil: inflatable deicing boots, thermal anti-ice leading edge, weeping wings
  - for windshield: alcohol anti-ice, electric heating anti-ice, defroster
  - for propeller: alcohol anti-ice, electric heating anti-ice, deicing boots
  - others: pitot heat, carb heat

- **gyroscopic principles**
  - rigidity in space: spinning gyro remains fixed in its plane of rotation, providing stability
  - precession: force is applied to gyro, resulting force occurs 90° ahead in the direction of rotation

  - **VSI**: shows rate-of-climb in fpm, 6-9sec delay, rate trend immediate
    - how: diaphragm direct static source, chamber receives static p via calibrated leak, climb/descend→diaphragm p change instantly, chamber change slowly→pressure diff→mechanical linkage→shows rate of climb
  - **ASI**: measures diff between impact(ram) air p (pitot tube) and ambient p (static port)
    - how: dynamic p (airspeed)=impact p - static p, diaphragm receives ram air p from pitot tube [faster→expand], air p↓ as alt↑ → ASI indicate slower → to correct → apply ambient p from static port → shows dynamic p as airspeed

  - using alternate static source → venturi effect → lower pressure
    - airspeed↑, altimeter↑, VSI (momentarily climb)
  - pitot tube: use pitot-heat
    - ram air inlet (x) & drain hole (o) → 0 (zero)

## Navigation
- **VOR**
  - full deflection 10° (5 dots, 2° deviation for dot), verify morse ID
  - **check**: [VOT±4/ground±4/airborne±6/dual-check 4 between two], every 30 days, check FROM 0 / TO 180, sensitivity (at 5th dot within 10°~12°)
  - sign: DEPS (Date / bearing Error / Place / Signature)
  - limit: cone of confusion (1 mile per 10,000ft), reverse sensing, require line-of-sight
- **DME:** auto tune with (VOR/LOC), slant range error (right above 6076ft shows 1NM), negligible 1NM per every 1000ft (you 5000ft? → negligible when 5NM away)
- **NDB**: low-mid freq band, older form → replacing, how: [sends signal all direction → ADF (automatic direction finder) points needle to NDB station]
- **ILS:** instrument landing system, localizer, glide slope, marker beacons, 
- **ILS failure**: **outside FAF (→switch LOC), inside FAF(→Missed)**
- **Localizer**: opposite end of rwy, lateral guide, width (3°-6°), threshold 700ft (350ft each from center), usually 5° total width (2.5° each side → 4x sensitive than VOR), coverage[10NM-35°/18NM-10°/4500ft]
- **glide slope**: vertical guide, auto tune /w LOC, interprets 90Hz/150Hz signal (90Hz>150Hz → above), width (1.4°, 0.7 for up/down deach), range (10NM), slope (3°)
- **marker beacons**: provides range information
  - | Marker Beacon       | Color   | Audio Pattern   | Distance from RWY                 | Height (AGL)      |
    |---------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
    | Outer Marker (OM)   | Blue    | --- (slow)      | 4~7miles (21000~37000ft)          | about 1400ft      |   
    | Middle Marker (MM)  | Amber   | -.-. (middle)   | 0.5~0.8miles (2600~4200ft)        | about 200~250ft   |
    | Inner Marker (IM)   | White   | ....(fast)      | near threshold (within 300~500ft) | below 100ft       |

- **GPS keywords**
  - **update every 28 days**
  - **GNSS**: all satellite system world-wide, including GPS (US GNSS - dep of Defense)
  - **GPS**: type of GNSS, operate by US dep of Defense
  - **SBAS**: **ground stations** → accuracy 10x↑, [WAAS(US)/EGNOS(EU)/KASS(KOR)]
  - **WAAS**: type of SBAS, FAA run, [error margin 3 meters / position accuracy 95%↑]
  - **GBAS**: installed near airport, GLS can replace ILS, accuracy↑ than WAAS but coverage↓)
  - **RAIM**: detects satellite error → gives warning, min 5 functioning required, WAAS GPS no need RAIM but built for backup
  - **TSO-C[129,196]**: non-WAAS GPS, no SBAS correction, alternate require non-GPS

- **RNAV NavSpecs**: lateral navigation accuracy, RNAV1 [DPs/STARs]: less 1NM err 95%, RNAV2 (enroute,T/Q-routes): less 2NM err 95%, RNAV10 (for oceanic)
- **how GPS works**
  - 5 satellites at any location→each satellites sends time-stamped signal→receiver measures travel time of signal→calculate distance to each satellite
  - 3 satellites → position (lat/long), 4 satellites → position & altitude
  - RAIM: GPS receiver monitors satellite signal integrity, min 5 (or 4+ altimeter input (baro-aided RAIM)), fault exclusion → min 6 (or 5 + alt input)
- **PBN**: set of navigation equip standards (particular NavSpecs), not dependent on single tech, procedure don’t need to be changed/renamed just because of new nav hardware

  - RNAV: no alerting
  - RNP: type of RNAV + [monitoring/alerting] function (RAIM or WAAS)
  - RNP0.3 approach: nav. sys. must maintain accuracy of 0.3NM or better from runway centerline during final approach segment → accuracy<standard?→alert
  - RNP approach minima and equipment:
    - GLS DA minima → require GBAS
    - LP MDA / LPV DA minima → require RNP achieved by WAAS.
    - LNAV / VNAV DA → achieved by VNAV-approved WAAS, or BARO-VNAV systems.
    - LNAV MDA → achieved by a basic, unaugmented IFR-approved GPS.
  - RNP Navigation Performance
    - Final Approach: RNP 0.3 (0.3 NM accuracy 95% of flight time)
    - Terminal & Departure: RNP 1.0 (1 NM accuracy 95% of the flight time)
    - Enroute: RNP 2.0 (2 NM accuracy 95% of the flight time)

## Approach
- **stabilized approach**: landing config, on profile, airspeed±10, descent rate 500~700 (no more than 1000), optimal RPM
- **chart reading**: TDZE(highest in first 3000’), THRE(threshold elev.), MSA(guarantees 1000’ obs. clear. within 25NM radius, no sig coverage), TCH (threshold crossing height)
  - **signs[T/A/Ana]**: T[non-standard TO mins / DP], A[non-standard IFR alternate min], Ana[alternate minimums not authorized=can’t be used as alternate airport]
  - **signs[snowflake]**: [Cold Temperature Airport](https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/Cold_Temp_Airports.pdf) X mark → altitude correction (AGL), [AIM 7-3 correction table](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap7_section_3.html#VnDuU1cfGeor) (how far below due to cold temperature induced error)
- **identify FAF**: precision (light-bolt), non-precision (maltese cross)
- **approach category**
  - **Based on final approach speed** (**1.3 times stall speed in landing configuration** at MGLW (maximum gross landing weight))
  - A ≤ 90, B (91-120), C (121-140), D (141-165), E > 165
- **descend below MDA/DA (91.175)**: normal descent rate, not less than visibility requirement, visual reference requirement
- **visual reference requirements**: runway environment in-sight
  - [threshold, runway, touchdown zone] markings or lights, REIL, VASI, PAPI
  - **ALS** : red terminating bars (ASLF-1) or red side row bars (ALSF-2) → descend below 100ft above TDZE
- **missed approach**
  - identify [precision: DA / non-precision: MAP]
  - execute when: “MDA→MAP or DH/DA” with insufficient visual ref, unsafe app, ATC
  - immediately go-missed when: CDI deflects 3/4-scale↑ (horizontal/vertical), RAIM lost, when below MDA/DA (visual contact lost, vis<minimum, not in normal pos.)
- **approach clearances**: when can you descend to next approach segment? → cleared for app. & established on segment of published app.
- **VDP**: non-precision, ‘V’ symbol on profile, no below MDA prior to reaching VDP
  - no VDP? → maintain MDA until 91.175 is met → descend
  - VDP on chart? then maintain MDA to VDP (even if 91.175 is met)
  - at VDP? → 91.175 meet? then descend, otherwise go missed
  - formula: (MDA in AGL) / 300 → NM, (MDA in AGL) / 10 → sec
- **VDA**: glide path from FAF to TCH (for non-precision), typically 3°, advisory only
- **IAP (Instrument Approach Procedures)**
  - **precision**: ILS, MLS, PAR, GLS, TLS → lateral & vertical guidance to DA
  - **non-precision**: VOR, LOC, RNAV/RNP to LNAV or LP Minima, LDA, SDF, ASR, NDB → lateral only to MDA, step-down
    - NDB, VOR, LOC: may use IFR-certified GPS as primary source until the FAF
  - **APV**: prevision-like, to DA, with vertical guidance but doesn’t meet precision standard
    - LDA with Glide Slope, LPV, LNAV/VNAV
- **other types of approach:** circling/visual/contact/radar-vectors/parallel/GLS
  - **circling**: course alignment↔rwy center exceeds 30°, approach name not include rwy (VOR/DME-B), remain 1.3NM (for category A) radius of all runways (B1.5, C1.7, D2.3, E4.5), visual ref lost while circling? (climbing turn to landing rwy → continue turn until established on missed course)
  - **visual**: pilot or ATC initiate (pilot can reject), vis≥3SM, ceiling≥1000 (IFR under VMC), must have [airport or traffic to follow] in-sight, pilot responsible visual separation
  - **contact**: similar to visual but SVFR, only init by pilot (no ATC), airport with IAP (ground vis≥1sm, remain Coc), obs. clr. pilot’s responsibility
  - **radar vectors to final**: at least 2NM outside FAF, until cleared [no turn to final / maintain last assigned altitude]
  - **parallel ILS**: provides 1 1/2 miles radar separation between aircraft
  - **GLS**: only 3 airports, KEWR, KIAH, Boeing private
- **LPV vs LNAV/VNAV**: 
  - LPV: requires WAAS, GPS based, no temperature error
  - LNAV/VNAV: non-WAAS ok, GPS + baro-VNAV based → temperature error

  - **MVA**: could be lower than MOCA, assigned by ATC.
  - **OROCA**: obstacle clearance within 1° grid square, no signal guaranteed (VFR MEF)
  - **MAA**: max authorized alt
  - **MSA**: guarantees 1000ft obstacle clearance within 25NM, no sig coverage
- **airport**: blue/green (IAP), brown (no-IAP), show only if hard-surface rwy 3000ft↑
- **airways**: V(victor, black, VOR), T(tango, blue, GPS)
- **reporting points**: VHF fix [on VOR radial, triangle, required report when not in radar contact], GPS fix [without VOR possible, RNAV navigation waypoint, T-Routes, Q-routes]
- **distance**: plain number(leg), rounded(cumulative), square(total), COP(change over point)
- **off airways navigation**: VOR only & below 18000ft ? → max distance between NAVAIDs = 80NM

## W/B
- **forward**: CG toward nose (stable)
  - ↑stable(↓maneuverable), stall↑, TOL roll↑, cruise effi↓
  - returns to level flight easily, harder to raise the nose, need↑elevator force
- **aft**: CG toward tail (maneuverable)
  - ↑maneuverable(↓stable), stall↓, TOL roll↓, cruise effi↑fuel↑
  - less stable, more likely to pitch up, less elevator force is needed
