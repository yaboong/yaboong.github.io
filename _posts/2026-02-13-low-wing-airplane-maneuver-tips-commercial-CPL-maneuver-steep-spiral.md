## Intro
---
- Personally, I find the **Steep Spiral** to be one of **the most challenging maneuvers**.
- After plenty of trial and error in **X-Plane**, I’ve finally had a bit of a breakthrough. 
- I’ve put together some **insights** and **tips** that I believe will make your training much more effective.

- **GS < 80**: Use a **30° bank**. (Don’t go much lower than this, or the radius gets too wide.)
- **GS = 90–95**: Stick to the **45° baseline**.
- **GS > 110**: Increase to a **55° bank** (But remember, **never exceed 60°**).

## Why the Steep Spiral is So Challenging
At first, I thought it was just a combination of **Turns Around a Point** and an **Emergency Descent**—both maneuvers I practiced during my Private Pilot training. 
I figured I just had to keep the wingtip on the reference point while descending rapidly, all while staying within bank and airspeed limits. 
It seemed simple enough in my head, but **the reality was quite different**.

#### 1. How much bank is enough?
The ACS states, "_Establish and maintain a steep spiral, not to exceed 60° angle of bank._" 
But does that mean **anything under 60°** is fine? Is 45° steep enough? What about 35° or 20°? 
The real challenge is **maintaining** a **constant radius** about a ground reference point. 
Finding that perfect balance between a specific bank angle and a consistent radius was personally the hardest part for me.

#### 2. What about the airspeed?
The ACS allows a margin of ±10 knots, but **±10 knots from what exactly?** 
Best glide speed? maneuvering speed? or just 90kts? 100kts?

#### 3. Time and Cost
The ACS requires **completing the maneuver no lower than 1,500 feet AGL**, and since you have to perform three full 360-degree turns, you need plenty of altitude. 
Even with a conservative estimate of 1,000 feet per turn, you need to start at least at 4,500 feet AGL. 
My instructor prefers starting at 5,500 feet MSL (airport elevation 120ft MSL) for an extra margin of safety. 
Because you have to climb so high for every single attempt, this maneuver **consumes significantly more time and money** compared to others.

#### 4. Different Perspectives (Left vs. Right Seat)
The **view** of the ground reference point is completely **different** for the **student in the left seat** and the **instructor in the right**. 
Because of these different angles, it's hard for the instructor to give precise advice based on exactly what I’m seeing at that moment.

#### 5. The "Low Wing" Struggle
In a **low-wing** aircraft, the wing often **blocks the very ground reference** you're trying to follow. 
Maintaining visual contact throughout the entire 360-degree turn is much more difficult than it looks.

#### 6. Coriolis Illusion
During a steady steep turn, the fluid in your inner ear stabilizes. 
If you **suddenly move your head** to check your GS on the instruments and then look back out at the reference point, it can trigger the **Coriolis Illusion**.

#### 7. Constantly Shifting Winds
Not only does the wind direction relative to the nose change as you turn, but the **wind speed and direction also shift as you descend to lower altitudes**. 
You have to account for these changes constantly.

#### 8. Everything Happens So Fast
As always in aviation, **everything happens in a flash**. 
There are so many variables changing at once that if you miss a small correction window, the whole maneuver can fall apart before you know it.

## Airplane Flying Handbook
> Update: This section has been updated based on feedback from a reader. Thanks to "_SeoulCitizen_"!

Let’s look at what the **FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (AFH)** says about the **Steep Spiral**.

{% include image_caption_href.html title="Airplane Flying Handbook 10-3" caption="Airplane Flying Handbook 10-3" imageurl="/posts_image/2026-02-13/AFH-10-3-steep-spiral.png" %}

The handbook uses key phrases such as 
"_rapidly dissipating substantial amounts of altitude_", "_remaining over a selected spot_", and "_useful during an emergency landing._" 
While these describe the maneuver's purpose, the execution details can still feel a bit vague.

Specifically, the handbook mentions the following regarding the setup:
{% include image_caption_href.html title="Airplane Flying Handbook 10-4" caption="Airplane Flying Handbook 10-4" imageurl="/posts_image/2026-02-13/AFH-10-4-steep-spiral-setup.png" %}

> Although "_gliding_" is mentioned multiple times (e.g., "_gliding turn_" "_gliding speed is established_"), 
I don't believe this implies the entire maneuver must be flown strictly at the best glide speed (Vg).

Since the text says "_once the proper airspeed is attained, the pitch should be lowered and the airplane rolled..._" after mentioning the initial glide setup, 
I interpret "_gliding speed_" as part of the **initial entry procedure rather than a strict requirement to maintain that exact airspeed throughout the entire steep spiral.**

#### How Steep is "Steep"?
How exactly do we define a "**steep**" turn? The **Airplane Flying Handbook** provides a very clear definition (_thanks again to "SeoulCitizen" for pointing this out_).
{% include image_caption_href.html title="Airplane Flying Handbook 3-12" caption="Airplane Flying Handbook 3-12" imageurl="/posts_image/2026-02-13/AFH-3-12-turn-bank-degree.png" %}
According to the **AFH**, "_turns are divided into three classes: shallow, medium, and steep_" where 
"_Steep turns—result from a degree of **bank of approximately 45° or more.**_"
Therefore, for a maneuver to be called a **Steep Spiral**, it must involve a bank angle of **at least approximately 45°**.

## So, What Are the Exact Numbers?
I’ve complained quite a bit, but that’s just because I truly believe the Steep Spiral is one of the trickiest maneuvers out there.
At the end of the day, the goal is to find the "sweet spot" for bank angle and airspeed, while figuring out how to handle wind correction. 
I went through a lot of trial and error in X-Plane to find these numbers. 
>⚠️ Keep in mind, these aren’t absolute values—they will change depending on the situation.

#### Reasoning behind Airspeed: 90 KIAS (and why Vg might not be ideal)
While some suggest using Best Glide Speed (Vg), I found it a bit risky for this maneuver. 
In a PA-28-161, Vg is around 73 KIAS. 
However, at a **60° bank**, your **stall speed increases by about 41%**. 
**Vs1** for PA-28-161 is **51**, and if you maintain a 60° bank while maintaining Vg (73), you're gonna be only 1 knot above (51*1.41=72) the stall speed.
That’s why I prefer **90 KIAS** (within the Va range of 88-111) to Vg.
And the reason why I didn't choose 100KIAS is, 100 is too close to the maximum maneuvering speed 111, even though it depends on the weight of the aircraft.
Therefore, I believe 90 KIAS is the sweet spot for a steep spiral.
- **Safety**: It provides a much **better stall margin**, especially when you're pulling steep banks.
- **Stability**: The aircraft feels more **stable** and **responsive** to control inputs, even if you encounter sudden gusts.

#### Bank Angle Strategy: 45° as the Baseline
Through my practice, I found that **45°** is a great **baseline**—but only if there’s **no wind**. 
To maintain a constant radius, you have to adjust based on your Ground Speed (GS):
- Approaching **Tailwind**: Your **GS increases**. You need a **steeper bank** here, or your turn radius will balloon out, taking you away from your reference point.
- Approaching **Headwind**: Your **GS decreases**. You need a **shallower bank** to prevent the circle from "pancaking" or getting too tight.

#### Downwind Entry - Wouldn't Headwind be easier? 
While a headwind entry might seem more "controlled" due to the slower initial ground speed (GS), it often leads to a common trap. 
I eventually realized that starting from the downwind (tailwind) leg is the most strategic way to stay within ACS limits.
- **The Problem with Headwind Entry**: Starting with a headwind requires a shallow bank initially. 
However, as you turn toward the tailwind side, your GS increases rapidly.
If the wind is strong, you may be forced to exceed a 60° bank just to maintain a constant radius—instantly busting the ACS limit
- **The Logic of Tailwind Entry**: Entering downwind forces you to establish your **steepest bank angle at the very beginning**. 
By "setting the ceiling" (up to 60°) when your GS is at its peak, the rest of the maneuver becomes a matter of gradually shallowing out the bank as you turn into the wind. 
It eliminates the risk of needing "more bank than you have left" halfway through the turn.

## The Simulation (X-Plane)
Since I can’t just go up and fly 50 times in the real world, I used X-Plane. 
Initially, I just wanted to see what the ground reference should look like from the cockpit, but I got a little obsessed... and here we are.
In the video below, I’ll show you three scenarios:
1. **Wind Calm**: How a constant **45°** bank and **90-95 KIAS** creates a perfect circle.
2. **Wind 180@20kts** & **No Correction**: What happens to your circle when you hold a steady 45° bank without accounting for the wind. 
3. **Wind 180@20kts** & **With Correction**: My experimental results on how to achieve that "constant radius" while staying **within the 60° ACS limit**.

### Rule of Thumb (based on GS)
- **GS < 80**: Use a **30° bank**. (Don’t go much lower than this, or the radius gets too wide.)
- **GS = 90–95**: Stick to the **45° baseline**.
- **GS > 110**: Increase to a **55° bank** (But remember, **never exceed 60°**).

> More GS, More Bank, More Back Pressure<br/>
Less GS, Less Bank, Less Back Pressure

### Why Back Pressure Matters
Wait, why did I mention **back pressure**? 
It’s all about maintaining that target airspeed (90-95 KIAS) while your bank angle constantly changes.

When **GS increases** (**Tailwind**):
> As you **increase** the **bank** to keep the radius constant, you **lose the vertical component of lift**. 
This causes the **nose** to **drop**, and your **airspeed** starts to **bleed upward**. 
To stay within the 90-95 KIAS range, you need to apply more back pressure to hold the pitch.

When **GS decreases** (**Headwind**):
> As you **shallow** out the **bank**, the **vertical lift increases**. 
If you keep the same pitch, the **nose will rise** and your **airspeed will drop**. 
To maintain your target speed, you need to relax the elevator—less back pressure (or even a slight forward pressure)—to keep the nose down.

### Track Log
It might not be perfect, but it gets the job done.
